# AURA Test Coverage Matrix

This is the living answer to: **what proves feature X works?**

## Current test baseline

- `tests/unit/foundation.test.ts` proves Vitest can execute TypeScript tests and load the AURA application entrypoint.
- `tests/unit/architecture-guardrails.test.ts` proves accepted/forbidden workspace edges, deep-import detection and circular-dependency detection.
- `pnpm run architecture` validates the real repository manifests and source imports.
- `pnpm run verify` is the canonical CI/local gate and currently includes repository structure, architecture boundaries, strict type checking and unit tests.
- Coverage percentage thresholds are intentionally not introduced yet; meaningful behavior does not exist yet to make a percentage useful.

## Planned Golden Scenarios

- `GS-001` login → room → walk → typing → chat.
- `GS-002` disconnect → reconnect/session resume.
- `GS-003` Polaris restart → AURA reconciliation.
- `GS-004` multiple real sessions share a room.
- `GS-005` AURA process restart → durable agent state restored.
